# Eagle's Eye Cybersecurity Governance Project

This repository contains Eagle's Eye's cybersecurity governance framework and data protection policies, focusing on enhancing data security, regulatory compliance, and incident response within a cyber-focused organizational structure. Eagle's Eye provides cybersecurity solutions categorized into three main areas: Cybersecurity Operations, Cloud Computing Protection, and Data Protection.

## Project Overview
The project outlines the data governance strategy and policies, covering aspects such as data classification, incident response, and data retention standards to ensure effective data management and protection. The project emphasizes clear roles and responsibilities and the application of security measures to protect sensitive data.

## Key Service Categories
- Cybersecurity Operations: Includes Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), penetration testing, and Security Operations Center (SOC) services.
- Cloud Computing Protection: Features Web Application Firewall (WAF) and protection against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
- Data Protection: Provides Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Email Protection to prevent data theft.

## Governance and Security Framework
1. Data Governance Policy: Establishes a framework for managing and protecting data assets, outlining roles like Data Owner, Data Controller, and Data Processor.
2. Data Classification Policy: Defines data sensitivity levels (Top Secret, Secret, Restricted, Public) to control data access and handling.
3. Incident Response Policy: Implements a structured approach to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents to protect data privacy.

## Key Risk Areas
- Financial Risks: Addressing unexpected costs, revenue loss, and investment stability.
- Operational Risks: Mitigating service downtime, data loss, and quality control issues.
- Information Risks: Preventing data breaches, privacy violations, and insider threats.

## Lessons Learned
The team gained expertise in data governance, risk assessment, and the challenges of implementing security policies, contributing to a robust and adaptable cybersecurity framework.
